Raycaster is a small ray-casting engine (go figure!) written in Java. There are two perspectives: the left provides an
overhead view of the raycasting, showing the ray collisions with the randomly-generated walls. The right side is a
pseudo-3D view of the map, similar to how the original Wolfenstein 3D works.

## Dependencies

This program uses my Theta library. The JAR file is
located [here](https://github.com/JoshuaCrotts/Theta/blob/master/lib/Theta.jar).

## Rebuilding Raycaster

Clone the repository to your computer and compile via your favorite IDE or terminal environment. Make sure to add the
Theta JAR to the build path.
